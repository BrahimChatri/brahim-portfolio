          </h2>

            <p>
              I'm <strong>Brahim Chatri</strong>, a 21-year-old backend-focused software engineer based in <strong>Agadir, Morocco</strong>. I specialize in building <strong>reliable, scalable, and maintainable backend systems</strong> with a focus on clean architecture and long-term code sustainability.
            </p>
            <p>
              My core stack is centered around <strong>Python</strong>, using frameworks like <strong>Django, Flask,</strong> and <strong>FastAPI</strong> to deliver robust APIs and backend services. I’m also learning <strong>Rust</strong> and <strong>Bash</strong> to expand my systems programming and automation capabilities. Alongside that, I work with tools like <strong>Git, Docker, Linux (Ubuntu)</strong>, and basic <strong>CI/CD</strong> to streamline development and deployment workflows. I also explore <strong>modern AI tools</strong> to boost my productivity and automate repetitive tasks wherever possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm deeply interested in <strong>software design principles</strong> and <strong>architecture</strong>, and I strive to write code that's not just functional, but thoughtfully designed and built to last. I enjoy working at night, when it's calm and quiet — that's when I get into deep focus and do my best work.
            </p>
            <p>
              While I’m still early in my journey, my long-term goal is to grow into an <strong>entrepreneur</strong> and eventually build <strong>impactful tech products or companies</strong> that solve real-world problems. I believe in staying curious, building with intention, and always aiming higher.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of coding, I value <strong>clarity, patience, and consistency</strong>. Whether I'm working on a personal project, contributing to open source, or exploring new tools, I approach everything with the mindset of learning and evolving.
